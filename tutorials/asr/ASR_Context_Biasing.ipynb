    "## Context-biasing: intro\n",
    "\n",
    "ASR models often struggle to recognize words that were absent or have few examples in the training data.\n",
    "This problem is especially acute due to the constant emergence of new names and titles in a rapidly developing world.\n",
    "It is essential for the users to be able to recognize these new words.\n",
    "Context-biasing methods attempt to solve this problem by assuming that we have a list of words and phrases (context-biasing list) in advance\n",
    "for which we want to improve recognition accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the directions of context-biasing methods is a `deep fusion` approach.\n",
    "These methods require integration into the ASR model and its training process.\n",
    "The main disadvantage of these methods is that they require a lot of computational resources and time to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another direction is methods based on `shallow fusion` approach. In this case, the only decoding process is modified.\n",
    "During the beam-search decoding, the hypothesis is rescored depending on the presence of the current word in the context-biasing list or external language model.\n",
    "The beam-search decoding may be computationally expensive, especially for the models with a large vocabulary and a large context-biasing list.\n",
    "This problem is considerably worsened in the case of the Transducer (RNNT) model since beam-search decoding involves multiple Decoder (Prediction) and Joint networks calculations.\n",
    "Moreover, the context-biasing recognition is limited by the initial predictions of the model. In the case of rare or new words,\n",
    "the model may not have a hypothesis for the desired word from the context-biasing list whose probability we want to improve."
